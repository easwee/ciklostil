# Ciklostil

Opinionated micro blog platform built with ActivityPub in mind. In active development.

*ciklostil â€” a method of duplicating texts using hand- or motor-driven machines with stencils made from impregnated paper.*

## Run locally

Ciklostil is built on top of the awesome [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework so all of the build and run commands from Astro apply.

To run locally:

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

## Code of conduct

Within the scope of this project, if a problem arises that can't be fixed by code, it's not a problem and will be ignored.
